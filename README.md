# ViBrain

ViBrain Project was developed under the supervision Dr. Rajiv Ratn Shah at IIIT Delhi
Worked on a commuting device and its support application for the visually impaired since I noticed that the white-cane is ineffective in helping them commute in a crowded setting. Floated surveys, conducted interviews and group discussions to get different perspectives on the problem. Came up with the concept for a device (later named ViBrain) based on the LiDAR®️ scanner, supported by haptic feedback and gyroscope sensors. ViBrain can scan the nearby surroundings, give directions to the user, and help them avoid accidents. It has a well designed, comfortable and ergonomic shape for easy handheld use for long durations.
